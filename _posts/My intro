## Hello ##

I have worked for around 4 years now even though I am not that experienced I had fortune of working on some different techologies and 
companies.I have worked in corporate IT to build Datawarehouses also had brief experience working for audit company(no we did not audit
any people lol).At all these companies I worked with data but we never explored it we just got and showed what we had so this course is 
sound really interesting and challenging as I am new to R and Python.I had my engineering in Electronics and communication but never 
wanted a career as was always interested in Computers.
