Team — Mayank Misra, Mandeep Singh

Goal — Create analytics dashboard to make better use of publicly available healthcare information. This could help patients, physicians, pharmaceutical companies and payors.

1.	Create a list of different datasources to procure healthcare claims, pharmaceutical and patient data
2.	Analyze the format in which data is available from these sources and scrape the data in a repository. Eg CSV, JSON, API, Website etc
3.	Create a database model  using these data sources to analyze the patient behavior, healthcare costs and sentiment analysis on the treatments
4.	Munge and analyze the raw data collected above and create a dashboard with different views for patients, physicians, pharmaceutical companies and payors
5.      We will be using a combination of Python, R, D3 and Github for coding 

## Long Term

1.	Develop predictive capabilities by leveraging clinical data with real-time data from sensor devices such as fidbit for preventive care
2.	Create longitudinal studies around the data collected above
