# Introduction #

I work in financial service industry as a development manager and have been living with data (and lots of dirty data) for 10+ years. I never consider myself as an advanced programmer. But I enjoy implementing beautiful GUI design whenever I can. My career began with a web developer/system analyst and I travelled frequently to different states. In terms of programming experience, now my strongest is SQL and C# is next. I am new to Python, D3, Git and GitHub. 

In my spare time, I do volunteer work in the weekend and build trading systems with structured data gathered from different sources. With the completion of certification program, I am hoping to learn the latest tools for data analysis and visualization and gain basic understanding in machine learning. For the mid-term goal, I'll continue to pursuit my big data ideas in the company.
